Coding Challenge of Insight Data Engineering Program

1, src

1.1 words_tweeted.py implements the first feature: Calculate the total number of times each word has been tweeted.

1.2 median_unique.py implements the second feature: Calculate the median number of unique words per tweet, and update this median as tweets come in.

Note that I need to use '\r\n' for newline when running the scripts at cygwin. I assume that your OS is Linux and change '\r\n' to '\n' in the final code

2, tweet_input

This folder stores input files. tweets.txt is an example input file


3, tweet_output

This folder stores output files. 

3.1 ft1.txt output file of words_tweeted.py

3.2 ft2.txt output file of median_unique.py

I ran run.sh and generated ft1.txt and ft2.txt here. When you run run.sh, the files are overrided

README.md explains the finalized project. run.sh is a shell script for running the source code
